## Positive Security Controls

The following are properly implemented:

- SQL Injection Prevention (parameterised Dapper queries)
- Rate Limiting (tiered policies: 100/min global, 10/5min auth, 60/min API)
- Security Headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, etc.)
- API Key Protection (constant-time comparison)
- Role-Based Authorization (admin endpoints)
- Password Hashing (ASP.NET Identity)
- Password Policy (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit, lockout after 5 attempts)
- Refresh Token Rotation
- HttpOnly Refresh Cookies
- Error Handling (stack traces hidden in production)
- Secrets Management (Azure Key Vault)
- CORS Hardening (restricted methods and headers)
- Input Validation (FluentValidation with safe character patterns - client-side)
- XSS Prevention (escapeHtml in JavaScript, Blazor auto-encoding, NameValidator sanitisation)
- Boost Race Condition Protection (database unique constraint)
- Deadline Enforcement (server-side UTC checks)
