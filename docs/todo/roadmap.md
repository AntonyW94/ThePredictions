# Year 1 Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap is grouped into three tracks, each ordered by priority:

1. **Infrastructure** - CI/CD, resilience, testing, monitoring. The foundation everything else builds on.
2. **Quick Wins** - Low-effort items that must be done (legal, auth gaps, polish).
3. **New Features** - User-facing functionality that drives engagement and retention.

Items already completed are listed at the bottom. Work top-to-bottom within each track. Infrastructure items should generally be tackled before features at the same priority level, since they de-risk everything that follows.

**Plan status key:**
- **Detailed plan** - Full implementation plan with numbered subtasks exists in `docs/todo/`
- **Outline** - README with requirements and technical notes exists in `docs/todo/`
- **Idea** - No plan document yet

## Track 1: Infrastructure

*CI/CD, resilience, testing, monitoring, and developer workflow.*

| # | Item | Effort | Why | Plan |
|---|------|--------|-----|------|
| 1 | CI workflow (`ci.yml`) | Low | Every subsequent change gets safer. Already fully spec'd | [Detailed plan](architecture/ci-cd/README.md) |
| 2 | Deploy workflow (`deploy.yml`) | Low | One-click deploys. Needs FTP secrets configured | [Detailed plan](architecture/ci-cd/README.md) |
| 3 | Database migrations (DbUp) | Medium | Manual schema changes across 3 databases is unsustainable | [Outline](architecture/database-migrations/README.md) |
| 4 | Request timeout configuration | Low | No explicit timeouts currently = silent hangs in production | [Outline](architecture/request-timeouts/README.md) |
| 5 | Validator tests (Phase 2) | Low | ~160 pure unit tests, no mocks. Quick coverage win | [Detailed plan](architecture/test-suite/phase-2-validator-tests/README.md) |
| 6 | Health check endpoints | Low | Small implementation, enables monitoring. Needed for alerting and E2E workflow | [Outline](architecture/health-checks/README.md) |
| 7 | Football API resilience | High | Site completely fails if the API goes down. Circuit breaker + caching essential | [Outline](architecture/football-api-resilience/README.md) |
| 8 | Database resilience | Medium | Connection pooling + retry policies for shared hosting | [Outline](architecture/database-resilience/README.md) |
| 9 | Alerting configuration | Medium | Datadog already integrated; add monitors so you know when things break | [Outline](architecture/alerting-configuration/README.md) |
| 10 | Distributed tracing / correlation IDs | Medium | Serilog request logging exists but no correlation ID middleware or headers yet | [Outline](architecture/distributed-tracing/README.md) |
| 11 | Caching strategy | High | Every request currently hits the database. Leaderboards/teams/seasons are obvious cache targets | [Outline](architecture/caching-strategy/README.md) |
| 12 | Pagination | Medium | Needed once you have real data volumes in leagues and leaderboards | [Outline](architecture/pagination/README.md) |
| 13 | Query handler integration tests (Phase 3) | Medium | Catches SQL mapping bugs. Highest-value test tier after domain tests | [Detailed plan](architecture/test-suite/README.md) |
| 14 | Command handler unit tests (Phase 5) | Medium | Test business logic orchestration with mocked repositories | [Detailed plan](architecture/test-suite/README.md) |
| 15 | Code consistency audit | Medium | Clean up tech debt now that patterns are established | [Outline](architecture/code-consistency-audit/README.md) |
| 16 | Query performance monitoring | Medium | Find slow queries before users feel them | [Outline](architecture/query-monitoring/README.md) |
| 17 | E2E tests with Playwright (Phase 7) | High | Confidence for critical user journeys | [Detailed plan](architecture/test-suite/README.md) |

## Track 2: Quick Wins

| 21 | Privacy & terms pages | Low | Legal requirement for any site collecting user data | [Outline](features/legal-compliance/privacy-terms-pages/README.md) |
| 22 | Signup legal checkboxes | Low | Legal requirement; depends on #21 existing first | [Outline](features/legal-compliance/signup-legal-checkboxes/README.md) |
| 23 | Email verification | Medium | DB column exists but no verification email or token flow yet. Must know emails are real | [Outline](features/authentication/email-verification/README.md) |
| 24 | Cookie consent | Medium | GDPR mandatory before public launch in the UK | [Outline](features/legal-compliance/cookie-consent/README.md) |
| 25 | Audit logging | Medium | Track who did what, for security and debugging | [Outline](security/audit-logging/README.md) |
